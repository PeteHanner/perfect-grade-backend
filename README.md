# PERFECT GRADE

### BACKEND

Capstone project for Flatiron School DC.

Students can enter all their assignments for a given semester, and upon pressing the "Make The Grade" button, receive back a "flattened" schedule. This adjusted schedule finds days with excess assignments and shifts them backwards to produce more consistent, regular workloads across a school semester.

Special thanks on this project to Tyler Curran, Rachael Tomlinson, Meghan Wingert, Tatiyahna Blakely, and Molly Magoffin. Extra special thanks to DaYoung Lee, JC Chang, and Shannon Nabors.
